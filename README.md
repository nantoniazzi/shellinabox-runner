All the apache related is not necessary :/
I tried to find a workaround around the platform lack of support with HTTP/1.1 and long polling... Without any success

[RUN-BEGIN]: # (cmd:run.sh)

```html,/project/target/src/index.html
```

```javascript,/project/target/src/hello.js
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world!");
}
```

[RUN-END]: #

test
